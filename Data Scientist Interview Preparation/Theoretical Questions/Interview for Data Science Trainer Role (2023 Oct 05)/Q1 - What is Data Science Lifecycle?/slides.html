    A data science lifecycle indicates the iterative steps taken to build, deliver and maintain
    any data science product. All data science projects are not built the same, so their life cycle varies as well.
    Still, we can picture a general lifecycle that includes some of the most common data science steps. A general data
    science lifecycle process includes the use of machine learning algorithms and statistical practices that result in
    better prediction models. Some of the most common data science steps involved in the entire process are data
    extraction, preparation, cleansing, modeling, evaluation etc. The world of data science refers to this general
    process as the “Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining”.

  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    The Lifecycle of Data Science
  </h1>
  <h2>1. Problem identification</h2>

  <p>
    This is the crucial step in any Data Science project. The first thing is understanding in what
    way Data Science is useful in the domain under consideration and identification of appropriate tasks which are
    useful for the same. <b>Domain experts and Data Scientists</b> <b>are the key persons in the problem
      identification of problem.</b> Domain expert has in depth knowledge of the application domain and exactly what
    the problem is to be solved. Data Scientist understands the domain and help in identification of problem and
    possible solutions to the problems.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h2 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    2. Business Understanding
  </h2>
  <p>
    Understanding what customer exactly wants from the business perspective is nothing but
    Business Understanding. Whether customer wish to do predictions or want to improve sales or minimize the loss or
    optimize any particular process etc forms the business goals. During business understanding, two important steps
    are followed:
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h2>KPI (Key Performance Indicator)</h2>
  <p>
    For any data science project, key performance indicators define the performance or success of
    the project. There is a need to be an agreement between the customer and data science project team on Business
    related indicators and related data science project goals. Depending on the business need the business indicators
    are devised and then accordingly the data science project team decides the goals and indicators. To better
    understand this let us see an example. Suppose the business need is to optimise the overall spendings of the
    company, then the data science goal will be to use the existing resources to manage double the clients. Defining
    the Key performance Indicators is very crucial for any data science projects as the cost of the solutions will be
    different for different goals.
  </p>
  <h2 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    SLA (Service Level Agreement)
  </h2>
  <p>
    Once the performance indicators are set then finalizing the service level agreement is
    important. As per the business goals the service level agreement terms are decided. For example, for any airline
    reservation system simultaneous processing of say 1000 users is required. Then the product must satisfy this
    service requirement is the part of service level agreement.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Once the performance indicators are agreed and service level agreement is completed then the
    project proceeds to the next important step.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    3. Collecting Data
  </h1>
  <p>
    Data Collection is the important step as it forms the important base to achieve targeted
    business goals. There are various ways the data will flow into the system as listed below:
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    1. Surveys
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Social media
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Archives
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Transactional data
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Enterprise data
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Statistical methods
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    4. Pre-processing data
  </h1>
  <p>
    Large data is collected from archives, daily transactions and intermediate records. The data
    is available in various formats and in various forms. Some data may be available in hard copy formats also. The
    data is scattered at various places on various servers. All these data are extracted and converted into single
    format and then processed. Typically, as data warehouse is constructed where the Extract, Transform and Loading
    (ETL) process or operations are carried out. In the data science project this ETL operation is vital and
    important. <b>A data architect role is important in this stage who decides the structure of data warehouse and
      perform the steps of ETL operations.</b>
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    5. Analyzing data
  </h1>
  <p>
    Now that the data is available and ready in the format required then next important step is to
    understand the data in depth. This understanding comes from analysis of data using various statistical tools
    available. <b>A data engineer plays a vital role in analysis of data.</b> This step is also called as Exploratory
    Data Analysis (EDA). Here the data is examined by formulating the various statistical functions and dependent and
    independent variables or features are identified. Careful analysis of data revels which data or features are
    important and what is the spread of data. Various plots are utilized to visualize the data for better
    understanding. The tools like Tableau, PowerBI etc are famous for performing Exploratory Data Analysis and
    Visualization. Knowledge of Data Science with Python and R is important for performing EDA on any type of data.

  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    6. Data Modelling
  </h1>
  <p>
    Data modelling is the important next step once the data is analysed and visualized. The
    important components are retained in the dataset and thus data is further refined. Now the important is to decide
    how to model the data? What tasks are suitable for modelling? The tasks, like classification or regression, which
    is suitable is dependent upon what business value is required. In these tasks also many ways of modelling are
    available. <b>The Machine Learning engineer applies various algorithms to the data and generates the output.
    </b>While modelling the data many a times the models are first tested on dummy data similar to actual data.

  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    7. Model Evaluation/ Monitoring
  </h1>
  <p>
    As there are various ways to model the data so it is important to decide which one is
    effective. For that model evaluation and monitoring phase is very crucial and important. The model is now tested
    with actual data. The data may be very few and in that case the output is monitored for improvement. There may be
    changes in data while model is being evaluated or tested and the output will drastically change depending on
    changes in data. So, while evaluating the model following two phases are important:
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    Data Drift Analysis
  </h1>
  <p>
    Changes in input data is called as data drift. Data drift is common phenomenon in data science
    as depending on the situation there will be changes in data. Analysis of this change is called Data Drift
    Analysis. The accuracy of the model depends on how well it handles this data drift. The changes in data are
    majorly because of change in statistical properties of data.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    Model Drift Analysis
  </h1>
  <p>
    To discover the data drift machine learning techniques can be used. Also, more sophisticated
    methods like Adaptive Windowing, Page Hinkley etc. are available for use. Modelling Drift Analysis is important as
    we all know change is constant. Incremental learning also can be used effectively where the model is exposed to
    new data incrementally.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    8. Model Training
  </h1>
  <p>
    Once the task and the model are finalised and data drift analysis modelling is finalized then
    the important step is to train the model. The training can be done is phases where the important parameters can be
    further fine tuned to get the required accurate output. The model is exposed to the actual data in production
    phase and output is monitored.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    9. Model Deployment
  </h1>
  <p>
    Once the model is trained with the actual data and parameters are fine tuned then model is
    deployed. Now the model is exposed to real time data flowing into the system and output is generated. <b>The model
      can be deployed as web service or as an embedded application in edge or mobile application. </b>This is very
    important step as now model is exposed to real world.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    10. Driving insights and generating BI reports
  </h1>
  <p>
    After model deployment in real world, the next step is to find out how the model is behaving
    in real-world scenario. The model is used to get insights that aid in strategic decisions related to business. The
    business goals are bound to these insights. Various reports are generated to see how business is driving. These
    reports help in finding out if key process indicators are achieved or not.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">
    11. Taking a decision based on insight
  </h1>
  <p>
    For data science to do wonders, every step indicated above has to be done very carefully and
    accurately. When the steps are followed properly, then the reports generated in the above step help in making key
    decisions for the organization. The insights generated help in taking strategic decisions for example, the
    organization can predict that there will be a need for raw materials in advance. Data science can be of great help
    in making many important decisions related to business growth and better revenue generation.
