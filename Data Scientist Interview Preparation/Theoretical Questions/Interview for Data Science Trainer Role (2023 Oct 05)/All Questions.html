  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q5: What is EDA? And, what is CDA?</h1>
  <p>In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main
    characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be
    used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby
    contrasts traditional hypothesis testing. Exploratory data analysis has been promoted by John Tukey since 1970 to
    encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data
    collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on
    checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making
    transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA. </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Initial Data Analysis</h1>
  <p>The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase, is that during
    initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that is aimed at answering the original research question.[109]
    The initial data analysis phase is guided by the following four questions:</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">1. Quality of data</h1>
  <p>The quality of the data should be checked as early as possible. Data quality can be assessed in several ways, using
    different types of analysis: frequency counts, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), normality
    (skewness, kurtosis, frequency histograms), normal imputation is needed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Analysis of extreme observations: outlying observations in the data are analyzed to see if they seem to disturb
    the distribution.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Comparison and correction of differences in coding schemes: variables are compared with coding schemes of
    variables external to the data set, and possibly corrected if coding schemes are not comparable.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Test for common-method variance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The choice of analyses to assess the data quality during the initial data analysis phase depends on the analyses
    that will be conducted in the main analysis phase.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">2. Quality of measurements</h1>
  <p>The quality of the measurement instruments should only be checked during the initial data analysis phase when this
    is not the focus or research question of the study. One should check whether structure of measurement instruments
    corresponds to structure reported in the literature.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There are two ways to assess measurement quality:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Confirmatory factor analysis</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Analysis of homogeneity (internal consistency), which gives an indication of the reliability of a measurement
    instrument. During this analysis, one inspects the variances of the items and the scales, the Cronbach's Î± of the
    scales, and the change in the Cronbach's alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">3. Initial transformations</h1>
  <p>After assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements, one might decide to impute missing data, or to
    perform initial transformations of one or more variables, although this can also be done during the main analysis
    phase.</p>
  <p>Possible transformations of variables are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Square root transformation (if the distribution differs moderately from normal)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Log-transformation (if the distribution differs substantially from normal)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Inverse transformation (if the distribution differs severely from normal)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Make categorical (ordinal / dichotomous) (if the distribution differs severely from normal, and no
    transformations help)</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">4. Did the implementation of the study fulfill the intentions of the research
    design?</h1>
  <p>One should check the success of the randomization procedure, for instance by checking whether background and
    substantive variables are equally distributed within and across groups.</p>
  <p>If the study did not need or use a randomization procedure, one should check the success of the non-random
    sampling, for instance by checking whether all subgroups of the population of interest are represented in sample.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Other possible data distortions that should be checked are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># dropout (this should be identified during the initial data analysis phase)</p>
  <p># Item non-response (whether this is random or not should be assessed during the initial data analysis phase)</p>
  <p># Treatment quality (using manipulation checks).</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">CDA: Confirmatory Data Analysis</h1>
  <p>Confirmatory data analysis (CDA) is a tool that is used to confirm or reject the measurement theory. In reality,
    exploratory and confirmatory data analysis are not performed one after another, but continually intertwine to help
    you create the best possible model.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Confirmatory Data Analysis involves things like: testing hypotheses, producing estimates with a specified level of
    precision, regression analysis, and variance analysis. In this way, your confirmatory data analysis is where you put
    your findings and arguments to trial.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q6: What is Descriptive Statistics? And, what is Inferential Statistics?</h1>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Descriptive statistics</h1>
  <p>A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or
    summarizes features from a collection of information, while descriptive statistics (in the mass noun sense) is the
    process of using and analysing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics
    (or inductive statistics) by its aim to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population
    that the sample of data is thought to represent. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike
    inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of probability theory, and are frequently nonparametric
    statistics.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and about the observations that have been made.
    Such summaries may be either quantitative, i.e. summary statistics, or visual, i.e. simple-to-understand graphs.
    These summaries may either form the basis of the initial description of the data as part of a more extensive
    statistical analysis, or they may be sufficient in and of themselves for a particular investigation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For example, the shooting percentage in basketball is a descriptive statistic that summarizes the performance of a
    player or a team. This number is the number of shots made divided by the number of shots taken. For example, a
    player who shoots 33% is making approximately one shot in every three. The percentage summarizes or describes
    multiple discrete events. Consider also the grade point average. This single number describes the general
    performance of a student across the range of their course experiences.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The use of descriptive and summary statistics has an extensive history and, indeed, the simple tabulation of
    populations and of economic data was the first way the topic of statistics appeared. More recently, a collection of
    summarisation techniques has been formulated under the heading of exploratory data analysis: an example of such a
    technique is the box plot.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the business world, descriptive statistics provides a useful summary of many types of data. For example,
    investors and brokers may use a historical account of return behaviour by performing empirical and analytical
    analyses on their investments in order to make better investing decisions in the future. </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Univariate analysis</h1>
  <p>Univariate analysis involves describing the distribution of a single variable, including its central tendency
    (including the mean, median, and mode) and dispersion (including the range and quartiles of the data-set, and
    measures of spread such as the variance and standard deviation). The shape of the distribution may also be described
    via indices such as skewness and kurtosis. Characteristics of a variable's distribution may also be depicted in
    graphical or tabular format, including histograms and stem-and-leaf display. </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Bivariate and multivariate analysis</h1>
  <p>When a sample consists of more than one variable, descriptive statistics may be used to describe the relationship
    between pairs of variables. In this case, descriptive statistics include:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># Cross-tabulations and contingency tables</p>
  <p># Graphical representation via scatterplots</p>
  <p># Quantitative measures of dependence</p>
  <p># Descriptions of conditional distributions</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The main reason for differentiating univariate and bivariate analysis is that bivariate analysis is not only a
    simple descriptive analysis, but also it describes the relationship between two different variables. Quantitative
    measures of dependence include correlation (such as Pearson's r when both variables are continuous, or Spearman's
    rho if one or both are not) and covariance (which reflects the scale variables are measured on). The slope, in
    regression analysis, also reflects the relationship between variables. The unstandardised slope indicates the unit
    change in the criterion variable for a one unit change in the predictor. The standardised slope indicates this
    change in standardised (z-score) units. Highly skewed data are often transformed by taking logarithms. The use of
    logarithms makes graphs more symmetrical and look more similar to the normal distribution, making them easier to
    interpret intuitively.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Inferential statistics (or Statistical Inference or Inferential Statistical
    Analysis)</h1>
  <p>Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of
    probability. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses
    and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned
    with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger
    population. In machine learning, the term inference is sometimes used instead to mean &quot;make a prediction, by
    evaluating an already trained model&quot;; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as
    training or learning (rather than inference), and using a model for prediction is referred to as inference (instead
    of prediction); see also predictive inference. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of
    sampling. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference
    consists of (first) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing
    propositions from the model.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Konishi &amp; Kitagawa state, &quot;The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be
    problems related to statistical modeling&quot;. Relatedly, Sir David Cox has said, &quot;How [the] translation from
    subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis&quot;.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The conclusion of a statistical inference is a statistical proposition. Some common forms of statistical
    proposition are the following:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p># a point estimate, i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest;</p>
  <p># an interval estimate, e.g. a confidence interval (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset
    drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true
    parameter value with the probability at the stated confidence level;</p>
  <p># a credible interval, i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;</p>
  <p># rejection of a hypothesis;</p>
  <p># clustering or classification of data points into groups.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Topics Covered in Inferential Statistics</h1>
  <p>The topics below are usually included in the area of statistical inference.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> 1. Statistical assumptions</p>
  <p> 2. Statistical decision theory</p>
  <p> 3. Estimation theory</p>
  <p> 4. Statistical hypothesis testing</p>
  <p> 5. Revising opinions in statistics</p>
  <p> 6. Design of experiments, the analysis of variance, and regression</p>
  <p> 7. Survey sampling</p>
  <p> 8. Summarizing statistical data</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q7: What are the Four Types of Analytical Studies?</h1>
  <p>Descriptive Analytics tells you what happened in the past. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Diagnostic Analytics helps you understand why something happened in the past. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Predictive Analytics predicts what is most likely to happen in the future. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Prescriptive Analytics recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q8: Ordinal categorical data vs Nominal categorical data</h1>
  <p>Ordinal categorical data are non-numerical pieces of information with implied order â for example, survey responses
    on a scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>And nominal categorical data are non-numerical pieces of information without any inherent order â for example,
    colors or states.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><b>Side Note:</b></p>
  <p>Questions 8 to 12 are related to âTypes of Dataâ.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Actual Interview Question:</p>
  <p><i>âHow do you figure out if the data is categorical or continuous?â</i></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q9: Categorical data vs Quantitative data</h1>
  <p>Quantitative variables are any variables where the data represent amounts (e.g. height, weight, or age). </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Categorical variables are any variables where the data represent groups. This includes rankings (e.g. finishing
    places in a race), classifications (e.g. brands of cereal), and binary outcomes (e.g. coin flips).</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q10: Categorical data vs Continuous data</h1>
  <p>Continuous data can take on any value within a defined range and is often measured on a continuous scale, such as
    weight, height, or temperature. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Categorical data, on the other hand, consists of discrete values that fall into distinct categories or groups, such
    as gender, ethnicity, or product types.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q11: Categorical data vs Numerical data</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Categorical data refers to a data type that can be stored and identified based on the names or labels given to
      them. </li>
    <li>Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form.
      Also known as qualitative data as it qualifies data before classifying it.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q12: Categorical data vs Discrete data</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Categorical data might not have a logical order. For example, categorical predictors include gender, material
      type, and payment method. </li>
    <li>Discrete variables are numeric variables that have a countable number of values between any two values. A
      discrete variable is always numeric.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q13: When do we use supervised learning?</h1>
  <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, meaning it
    is provided with input-output pairs (also known as features and labels) and learns to map the input to the
    corresponding output. Supervised learning is used in a wide range of applications whenever you have a dataset with
    known outcomes and want to build a predictive model. Here are some common scenarios where supervised learning is
    applied:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Classification: When you want to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. Examples include email spam
    detection, image classification (e.g., identifying objects in images), sentiment analysis (determining if a text is
    positive or negative), and disease diagnosis (categorizing patients as having a specific disease or not).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Regression: When you want to predict a continuous numeric value. Examples include predicting house prices based on
    features like square footage and location, forecasting stock prices, or estimating the time it will take to complete
    a task.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Recommendation Systems: When you want to make personalized recommendations to users. This is common in
    applications like movie recommendations (Netflix), product recommendations (Amazon), and content recommendations
    (YouTube).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Natural Language Processing (NLP): In NLP, supervised learning is used for tasks like named entity recognition,
    text classification, machine translation, and chatbot responses. For instance, training a model to classify news
    articles into different categories like sports, politics, or entertainment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Speech Recognition: In applications like voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), supervised learning is used to
    transcribe spoken words into text.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Computer Vision: Supervised learning is crucial for image and video analysis tasks such as object detection,
    facial recognition, and autonomous driving (identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and road signs).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Anomaly Detection: Detecting unusual patterns or outliers in data, such as fraud detection in financial
    transactions, network intrusion detection, and equipment failure prediction in industrial settings.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Handwriting Recognition: Converting handwritten text into machine-readable text, often used in applications like
    OCR (Optical Character Recognition).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Biomedical and Healthcare: In medical imaging, supervised learning is used for tasks like tumor detection in MRI
    scans, disease diagnosis based on medical data, and drug discovery.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Game Playing: Supervised learning can be used to train agents in games like chess, Go, or video games to make
    decisions based on historical gameplay data.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Supervised learning is a versatile and widely used technique in machine learning, and its applications extend to
    various domains where predictive modeling, classification, or regression tasks are required, and labeled training
    data is available.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q14: When do we use unsupervised learning?</h1>
  <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning it
    does not have access to predefined output labels. Instead, the algorithm aims to discover hidden patterns,
    structures, or relationships within the data. Here are some common scenarios where unsupervised learning is used:
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Clustering: Unsupervised learning is frequently used for clustering, where the goal is to group similar data
    points together based on their inherent similarities or patterns. Common clustering algorithms include k-means
    clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Applications include customer segmentation in marketing, image
    segmentation, and grouping similar news articles for recommendation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Dimensionality Reduction: Unsupervised learning techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
    t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are used to reduce the dimensionality of data. This is helpful
    for visualization, feature selection, and improving the efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Dimensionality
    reduction can be used in image compression, anomaly detection, and more.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning can be used to identify rare or anomalous data points that do not conform
    to the normal patterns in the dataset. This is valuable for fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and
    quality control in manufacturing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Density Estimation: Unsupervised learning can be used to estimate the probability distribution of data. This is
    useful in various applications, including anomaly detection, outlier detection, and generative modeling.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Topic Modeling: In natural language processing, unsupervised learning techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are used for topic modeling. These methods help identify
    underlying topics in a collection of text documents, making them useful for text summarization, content
    recommendation, and document organization.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Recommendation Systems: Unsupervised learning can be used to find similarities between users or items in a
    recommendation system. While recommendation systems often involve collaborative filtering, which can be considered a
    form of unsupervised learning, they may also use supervised learning in conjunction with user ratings.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Generative Modeling: Unsupervised learning is used in generative modeling, where the goal is to generate new data
    samples that are similar to the training data. Examples include Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are used in image generation, style transfer, and data augmentation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Market Basket Analysis: In retail and e-commerce, unsupervised learning can be applied to discover associations
    between products purchased together by customers. This information can be used for product recommendations and
    inventory management.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Unsupervised learning is valuable when you want to explore and understand the structure and relationships within
    your data, especially when you don't have access to labeled data or when the goal is to discover hidden patterns. It
    is a versatile approach used in various domains, including data analysis, pattern recognition, and exploratory data
    analysis.</p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Q15: When a Data Science problem is given to you by your company, what strategy
    you will follow to solve the problem? What is your approach?</h1>
  <p>Solving a data science problem for a company involves a systematic and well-structured approach. Here's a general
    strategy and approach that you can follow:</p>
  <p>1. Understand the Problem:</p>
  <p>Start by thoroughly understanding the problem statement and its business context. Engage in discussions with
    stakeholders and subject matter experts to gain insights into the problem's significance and objectives.</p>
  <p>2. Define Clear Goals:</p>
  <p>Clearly define the objectives and goals of the project. What specific outcomes or insights are you aiming to
    achieve? Establish measurable success criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of your solution.</p>
  <p>3. Data Collection and Exploration:</p>
  <p># Identify the data sources and collect the relevant data required for the project. This may involve data
    acquisition, data scraping, or access to existing databases.</p>
  <p># Perform initial data exploration and visualization to gain insights into the data's characteristics, such as
    distributions, missing values, outliers, and correlations.</p>
  <p>4. Data Preprocessing:</p>
  <p>Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing
    values, encoding categorical variables, scaling/normalizing numerical features, and addressing outliers.</p>
  <p>5. Feature Engineering:</p>
  <p>Create relevant features or transform existing ones to improve the model's performance. This step often requires
    domain knowledge and creativity.</p>
  <p>6. Model Selection:</p>
  <p>Based on the nature of the problem (e.g., classification, regression, clustering), select appropriate machine
    learning algorithms or techniques. Consider factors such as the volume of data, data dimensionality, and
    interpretability of the model.</p>
  <p>7. Model Training:</p>
  <p># Split the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.</p>
  <p># Train the selected models on the training data, tune hyperparameters using cross-validation, and assess their
    performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.</p>
  <p>8. Model Evaluation:</p>
