  <p>
    1. How much would you rate yourself out of 1 to 5 in these three:
  </p>
  <p>
    Data engineering, ML Ops, Cloud
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Broad concepts around Data Engineering and MLOps.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Write code to find the number of factors of a number.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
<pre>
<i class="ib">
import math
n = int(input("The number:"))

sqrt_n = math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))

l = set({})

for i in range(1, sqrt_n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
        q, r = divmod(n, i)
        l.add(i)
        l.add(q)

print(l)
print(len(l))
</i>

Sample output:
The number:12
{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}
6

The number:100
{1, 2, 4, 100, 5, 10, 50, 20, 25}

</pre>
  <p>
    4. Tell what is the complexity of this code.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Can you suggest any optimization in it?
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
  <p>
    6. Write code to tell if a number is a happy number.
  </p>
  <p>
    A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
  </p>
  <p>
    - Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of it’s
      digits
  </p>
  <p>
    - Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it “loops endlessly in
      a cycle” which does not include 1
  </p>
  <p>
    - Those numbers for which this process “ends in 1” are happy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    For ex: 19 is a happy number. Produces following sum of the squares of it’s digits: 19, 82,
      68, 100, 1
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    And 2 is an unhappy number.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    7. How would you identify an unhappy number for example: 2
  </p>
  <p>
    A number is either a happy number or unhappy number. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We can create a list of all the happy numbers till 1000 and a list of unhappy numbers. Then
      preemptively stop on encountering one of those.
  </p>
  <p>
    This way memoization would allow for optimization.

  <p>
    8. Which ML algorithm you are most comfortable with?
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Can you take up questions on SVM?
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    10. The Machine Learning problem:
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s say you work in a financial institution, and you are given the task of using Support
      Vector Machines (SVM) to build a trading strategy for equities based on multiple features, such as moving average,
      volatility, and market sentiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Problem Statement:
  </p>
  <p>
    To create an optimized SVM model that can effectively classify equities into “Buy”, “Hold”,
      and “Sell” categories based on historical and real time data.
  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Build an initial SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) or polynomial kernel. Experiment
      with different parameters like the regularization constant (C), kernel coefficient (y), and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss how are you going to do this.
  </p>
  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
  <p>
    11. How would you tune the hyper parameters of the model?
