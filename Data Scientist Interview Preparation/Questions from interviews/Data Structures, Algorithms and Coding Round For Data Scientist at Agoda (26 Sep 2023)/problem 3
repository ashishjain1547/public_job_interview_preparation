You want to buy a billboard featuring the name of your company. The price of the billboard is the sum of the price of the letters in your company name. For example, the price of company name "aga" is two times the price of letter "a" plus the price of letter "g". You don't know the price per letter, but you do know the prices of other company names. Can you derive the price of your company name? A company name only contains letters from the alphabet. There are 26 different letters and they are all lower case.

You are given:

    your_company_name: a string representing the name of your company
    other_company_names: a list of strings where each element is the name of another company
    other_company_prices: a list of real numbers where other_company_prices[i] is the price of other_company_names[i]

Return the price of your company name if it can be derived, otherwise return -1

Constraints:
The length of a company name is maximally 100
len(other_company_names) = len(other_company_prices) <= 100
For each price in other_company_prices: -10^6 <= price <= 10^6

Sample Input:
your_company_name = "aabc"
other_company_names = ["ab", "ac", "bd"]
other_company_prices = [99.5, 1000.2, 2000.8]

Sample Output:
1099.7

Explanation: The letters in "aabc" is the union of the letters in "ab" and "ac", hence the price is the sum.

Sample Input:
your_company_name = "d"
other_company_names = ["aab", "acc"]
other_company_prices = [500, 6000]

Sample Output:
-1

Explanation: The letter d doesn't appear in any other company name and therefore we cannot derive its price.
