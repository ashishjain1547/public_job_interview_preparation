My last project at Infosys was in MDM (which stands for Master Data Management) for Tyson Foods.

Project Goal:
Tyson Foods wanted to capture accurate details about items sold via POS devices in it's reporting tools, visualizations and reports for sales and marketing teams.

Focus on client value:
The existing system of managing data about sold items was done by Data Stewards. With MDM in place, Tyson Foods was trying to reduce work load on Data Stewards and make the process more automated. This initiative led to reduced costs and expenses on human effort and led to overall improved efficiency by reducing the input required by human intervention.

Technical details:

Basically, the type of MDM solution implemented for Tyson Foods was a 'Product MDM' and it was for retailers like Kroger, IRI, Walmart, Amazon, Instacart, Meijer, among others.

The data was uploaded to a file server by the client in the form of flat files.
The flat files were then read by Python scripts in the GCP to load the data into Postgre SQL databases.
From PostgreSQL the data was loaded into Pandas dataframes and PySpark dataframes, from where it was then processed by lazy learning algorithms.

These were simple algorithms based on a couple of techniques such as:

1. First word model : Used to create a "hierarchical classifier" that started from brand, manufacturer, then megacategory, then category, then subcategory, then protien, packaging, weight, bone, etc.
Starting point is the first word that is an abbreviation for brand for most retailers.

2. Bag of words model 

3. n-gram model 

Along with the AI/ML was in order the "Reject Option" that was used if model's confidence was lower than a threshold and Tyson Foods needed a human reviewer to fill in the details for a record.
